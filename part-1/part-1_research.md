## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a branch of computer science focused on building systems that **learn from data**.  
Rather than following fixed rules like traditional programs, ML models uncover hidden patterns in datasets to make predictions or decisions.

### Research Topics

Before getting started do your research on machine learning and be able to **at least** answer the following questions:

- What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
# Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

| Feature                     | **Supervised Learning**                             | **Unsupervised Learning**                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Labeled Data**           | Requires labeled data (input-output pairs)          | No labeled data required                           |
| **Objective**              | Predict output from input                           | Discover hidden patterns or structure              |

| Are you answering **‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù** | No             | Yes        |

- Are there ML problems that fall outside classification and regression?
## üß† ML Problem Types Beyond Classification & Regression

| Problem Type              | Description                                                                 | Example Use Cases                          |

- What is skewed data and how to mitigate it's effect?
   
   üìâ What Is Skewed Data?
   Skewed data occurs when the distribution of your target variable (typically in classification) is imbalanced‚Äîi.e., some classes appear far more frequently than others.
   
   Example: In a medical dataset, 95% of patients might be healthy, and only 5% have a rare disease.
   
   Result: A model could "cheat" by always predicting the majority class and still achieve high accuracy.
   
## ‚öñÔ∏è Techniques to Handle Skewed Data

| Technique                       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resampling: Oversampling**    | Duplicate examples from the minority class (e.g. SMOTE)                     |
| **Resampling: Undersampling**   | Remove examples from the majority class                                    |
| **Class Weights**               | Assign higher weights to minority class during training                    |
| **Anomaly Detection Approach**  | Treat minority class as an outlier or rare event                           |
| **Change Evaluation Metrics**   | Use metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC instead of Accuracy       |
| **Generate Synthetic Data**     | Use techniques like GANs or SMOTE to synthesize new minority examples       |
| **Stratified Sampling**         | Ensure each class is proportionally represented in training/test splits     |
